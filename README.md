## Project overview

*Solar Wind* is a social matching app designed to connect people based on shared sports and fitness interests. Users specify their preferred activities, locations, and availability, and the app suggests compatible partners. 
Whether you're looking for a workout partner, or just want to meet new people who love staying active, this is the place to start. From casual joggers to competitive players â€” everyone is welcome.

**Key Features:**

- Personalized matching: user feed suggests people with similar sports preferences, schedules, and locations.
- Profile customization: add sports interests, skill levels, and availability.
- Direct Telegram integration: after users have added each other as friends within the app, they can redirect to Telegram chat for further coordination.
- Community-oriented: encourages local meetups and long-term fitness relationships.
